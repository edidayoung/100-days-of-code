# 100 Days Of Code - Daily Log

### Day 0: September 26 Friday, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Started creating a ToDo app from scatch using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Currently the app has only a add new task feature for now. The task list display designs are not completed yet.

**Thoughts:** Its been a while i wrote code from scratch and currently i just keep thinking its so hard and how do all the youtuber do it really ( by the way, am using a youtube video to build the app). I hope within 2Months i should actually be able to build demo small projects using on documentations.

### Day 1: September 27 Saturday, 2025

**Today's Progress:**  Added the Delete and Edit features for the app and also making its usability responsive.

**Thoughts:** My development so far has been really impressive, tho i am still following the tutorial on youtube but the exposure to new object and properties are viable.

### Day 2: September 28 Sunday, 2025

**Today's Progress:** I have completed my ToDo App. Thing changed/added:
i. Added the progressBar for the ToDos
ii. Implemented a celeberation feature and text change after all todos have been Completed.
iii. Added a Local Storage for the tasks. 

**Thoughts:** The YouTube Tutorials had some little bugs that i couldn't fix and i decided to use AI to rewrite the JS for the app, tho i dont fully understand the differnt builtIn functions, methods and object/properties used by AI but i'd make sure i am able to understand everything the code does and try rewriting it alone from scratch but with more tweaks and updates.

**Status:** Completed ToDos App. Let me Know what you think of the app in the comment section.

### Day 3: September 29 Monday, 2025

**Today's Progress:** Started creating the scientific calculator with chatGPt though all the login and UX arent that perfect but this is the final reult from todays work.

**Thoughts:** Honestly i'd have to study the use of built in object and what i would advice is that try as much as possible to write out code manually this'll make you have a glimpes of understanding on what your actually doing.

### Day 5: October 1 Wednessday, 2025

**Today's Progress:** Studies JS with FreeCode Camp. Working with Arrays and for Loops.

**Thoughts:** Arrays and Loops are one of the best syntax to understand . My learning curve would be only better if am consistent and dont skip anydays of this coding challenge.

### Day 6: October 2 Thursday, 2025

**Today's Progress:** Started Working on a new API usage Project today which is a GitHub User Finder. This project is about 70% complete. HTML and CSS have been completed for today, tomorrow i'll be writing the JS for the project.

**Thoughts:** Working with HTML and CSS for a whole day, to be honest i feel a little relieved cause i didnt encounter spirit breaking bugs (smiles).But Tomorrow is gonna be a full JS day and hopefully the app wil be ready tomorrow.

### Day 7: October 3 Friday, 2025

**Today's Progress:** Today i completed the full JS code for the GitHub Finder App as promised. The app is working smoothly now.

**Thoughts:** JS logic requires real critical thinking, though i do not fully understand the full logic and when to use a built-in-fucntion or objects but i can proudly say am starting to get a hang on it.

**Status:** Completed GitHub User Finder . What other feature do you think will make this project stand out more!!

### Day 8: October 4 Saturday, 2025

**Today's Progress:** I learnt about loops today with freecode camp.

**Thoughts:** Loops in js always wait for the condition to be false before the loops stop which means that without a condition being met the loops continues.
