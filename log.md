# 100 Days Of Code - Daily Log

### Day 0: September 26 Friday, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Started creating a ToDo app from scatch using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Currently the app has only a add new task feature for now. The task list display designs are not completed yet.

**Thoughts:** Its been a while i wrote code from scratch and currently i just keep thinking its so hard and how do all the youtuber do it really ( by the way, am using a youtube video to build the app). I hope within 2Months i should actually be able to build demo small projects using on documentations.

### Day 1: September 27 Saturday, 2025

**Today's Progress:**  Added the Delete and Edit features for the app and also making its usability responsive.

**Thoughts:** My development so far has been really impressive, tho i am still following the tutorial on youtube but the exposure to new object and properties are viable.

### Day 2: September 28 Sunday, 2025

**Today's Progress:** I have completed my ToDo App. Thing changed/added:
i. Added the progressBar for the ToDos
ii. Implemented a celeberation feature and text change after all todos have been Completed.

**Thoughts:** The YouTube Tutorials had some little bugs that i couldn't fix and i decided to use AI to rewrite the JS for the app, tho i dont fully understand the differnt builtIn functions, methods and object/properties used by AI but i'd make sure i am able to understand everything the code does and try rewriting it alone from scratch but with more tweaks and updates.

**Status:** Completed ToDos App. Let me Know what you think of the app in the comment section.
