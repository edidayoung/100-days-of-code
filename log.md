# 100 Days Of Code - Daily Log

### Day 0: September 26 Friday, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Started creating a ToDo app from scatch using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Currently the app has only a add new task feature for now. The task list display designs are not completed yet.

**Thoughts:** Its been a while i wrote code from scratch and currently i just keep thinking its so hard and how do all the youtuber do it really ( by the way, am using a youtube video to build the app). I hope within 2Months i should actually be able to build demo small projects using on documentations.

### Day 1: September 27 Saturday, 2025

**Today's Progress:**  Added the Delete and Edit features for the app and also making its usability responsive.

**Thoughts:** My development so far has been really impressive, tho i am still following the tutorial on youtube but the exposure to new object and properties are viable.
