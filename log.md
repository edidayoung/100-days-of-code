**Today's Progress**: Started creating a ToDo app from scatch using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Currently the app has only a add new task feature for now. The task list display designs are not completed yet.

**Thoughts:** Its been a while i wrote code from scratch and currently i just keep thinking its so hard and how do all the youtuber do it really ( by the way, am using a youtube video to build the app). I hope within 2Months i should actually be able to build demo small projects using on documentations.
